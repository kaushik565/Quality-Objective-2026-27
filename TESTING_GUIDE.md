# 🧪 Testing & Verification Guide

## Quick Verification Checklist

### 1. QualityObjectives State Consolidation ✓
**Test the modal state management:**

```
[ ] Navigate to Quality Objectives slide
[ ] Click "Objective 04" card → Modal should open
[ ] Click "QI 1" button → Site details should display
[ ] Click a different QI (e.g., "QI 2") → Previous QI should close
[ ] Switch to Objective 05 → All modals should close
[ ] Switch back to Objective 04 → State should be fresh (no modals open)
[ ] Open Objective 06 → Should work independently
[ ] Verify no console errors
```

**Expected:** Modal state now manages 5 pieces of state in 1 object without bugs

---

### 2. ProcessImprovements useMemo ✓
**Verify filter optimization:**

```
[ ] Open ProcessImprovements slide
[ ] Hover over "Completed" items → Expand state works
[ ] Hover over "In Progress" items → Expand state works
[ ] Switch to different slide and back → State resets correctly
[ ] Check browser DevTools Performance tab:
    - Should NOT see filter operations on re-render
    - Same array references should be returned
```

**Expected:** No filter recalculations between renders

---

### 3. LabQAOverview Memoization ✓
**Verify data memoization:**

```
[ ] Open Lab QA Overview slide
[ ] Click SITE-I card → Should expand without delay
[ ] Switch to different slide and back → Data loads correctly
[ ] Check browser DevTools React Profiler:
    - sitesData should use same reference across renders
    - COLORS array should be constant
[ ] Charts should render smoothly with stable data
```

**Expected:** Large data structures memoized, no re-creation per render

---

### 4. ErrorBoundary Protection ✓
**Test error handling (simulated):**

```
[ ] Navigate through all slides normally
[ ] Verify all slides display without errors
[ ] If a component has an error:
    - ErrorBoundary UI should display
    - Should show: "⚠️ Slide Error"
    - User can navigate away with arrows
[ ] Check browser console:
    - Should see error logged
    - No unhandled promise rejections
```

**Expected:** If any slide component breaks, graceful error UI appears

---

### 5. DOM Cleanup ✓
**Verify DOM manipulation removed:**

```
[ ] Open DevTools Elements inspector
[ ] Navigate between slides repeatedly
[ ] Watch the DOM:
    - Should NOT see sections getting display: 'none'
    - Should NOT see excessive DOM queries
    - Should be smooth and performant
[ ] Measure navigation time:
    - Should be <100ms from key press to new slide visible
```

**Expected:** No DOM manipulation, Reveal.js handles rendering

---

### 6. CSS Variable Cleanup ✓
**Verify unused variable removed:**

```
[ ] Open src/styles.css
[ ] Search for "--mid": 
    - Should NOT find in :root variables
    - Should still find in component styles that use it
[ ] Verify all slides still render correctly
[ ] Check that color scheme is unchanged
```

**Expected:** --mid definition removed, all colors still work

---

## 🔧 Browser DevTools Testing

### Chrome DevTools Performance Profiling

**Before & After Comparison:**

```javascript
// Test in browser console:
// 1. Navigate to a slide and measure render time
performance.mark('slide-start')
// [Navigate to new slide]
performance.mark('slide-end')
performance.measure('slide-navigation', 'slide-start', 'slide-end')
performance.getEntriesByType('measure')[0].duration
// Should be: <200ms
```

### React DevTools (if installed)

```
[ ] Install React DevTools extension
[ ] Open Profiler tab
[ ] Navigate through slides
[ ] Check "Render" timeline:
    - Should see individual component renders
    - Memoized components should have stable references
    - QualityObjectives should show single state object
[ ] Check "Why did this render?" for each component
```

## 📋 Manual Testing Script

**Run through this sequence to verify all fixes:**

```
1. Start presentation (should load cleanly)
2. Navigate Slide 1 → Slide 2 (no flicker)
3. Go to Quality Objectives slide:
   - Click Objective 04 card
   - Verify modal opens correctly
   - Click QI 1, QI 2, QI 3 buttons
   - Verify only one QI is active at a time
   - Click QI again to close
4. Click different objective (05, 06, 07):
   - Verify each manages state independently
5. Switch to ProcessImprovements slide:
   - Hover over items to expand
   - Verify expand/collapse works
6. Open Lab QA Overview:
   - Click on SITE-I, SITE-III, SITE-V
   - Verify clicking closes previous selection
7. Navigate backward through slides:
   - Quality Objectives → Lab QA → IPQA Overview, etc.
   - Verify no errors in console
8. Return to Quality Objectives:
   - Verify all modals are closed (fresh state)
9. Repeat navigation cycle 5-10 times:
   - Watch for memory leaks
   - Watch for console errors
   - Watch for performance degradation
```

## 🚨 Known Issues to Monitor

### Issue 1: Browser Compatibility (CSS scrollbar)
**Severity:** LOW  
**Status:** Pre-existing (not from this fix)  
**Note:** Chrome < 121, Safari don't support scrollbar-width/scrollbar-color

```css
/* Current code uses these properties */
scrollbar-width: thin;        /* Firefox only */
scrollbar-color: #b91c1c #f1f1f1;  /* Firefox only */
```

**Workaround:** Works fine in Chrome/Safari, just uses default scrollbar

### Issue 2: Modal Close on Slide Change
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** Implemented via CustomEvent  
**Note:** Requires 'closeAllModals' event to be fired

```javascript
// In Presentation.jsx - fires on every slide change
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('closeAllModals'))

// Components must listen:
useEffect(() => {
  const handleCloseModals = () => { /* reset state */ }
  window.addEventListener('closeAllModals', handleCloseModals)
  return () => window.removeEventListener('closeAllModals', handleCloseModals)
}, [])
```

**Verification:** All slides have this listener implemented ✓

## 📊 Performance Baseline

After implementing fixes, expect:

| Metric | Target | Method |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Navigation time | <200ms | Chrome DevTools Performance |
| Memory usage | No growth | Chrome DevTools Memory |
| Component renders | Optimized | React DevTools Profiler |
| State updates | 1 per modal | React DevTools |

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Modal doesn't close when switching slides
**Solution:** 
- Verify slide components have closeAllModals listener
- Check that handleCloseModals resets all state
- Check browser console for event listener errors

### Problem: QualityObjectives state acting strangely
**Solution:**
- Open React DevTools Profiler
- Check activeModals object structure
- Verify all conditional checks use correct keys (qi04, qi05, etc.)
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Problem: Performance still degraded
**Solution:**
- Check DevTools Performance tab for unexpected DOM queries
- Verify no console errors
- Check that memoized components receive stable prop references
- Consider profiling with React DevTools Profiler
